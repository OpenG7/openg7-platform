## Summary
Describe the change (scope, motivation, user or technical impact).

## Details / decisions
- Design choices or tradeoffs
- Documentation or configuration impact

## Anti-duplication checklist
- [ ] I reviewed docs/ecosystem/ECOSYSTEM-MAP.md
- [ ] I confirmed whether this capability already has a canonical repo
- [ ] If reusable by 2+ repos, I proposed a shared @openg7/* package instead of copy/paste
- [ ] I did not introduce canonical domain logic into openg7-nexus

## Tests
- [ ] `yarn lint`
- [ ] `yarn format:check`
- [ ] `yarn validate:selectors`
- [ ] `yarn codegen && yarn test`
- [ ] `yarn predeploy:cms-cache`
- [ ] `yarn prebuild:web`
- [ ] Other (specify):

## Review
- [ ] Docs updated (README, docs, or comments)
- [ ] Screenshot attached if UI
- [ ] Linked issue referenced
