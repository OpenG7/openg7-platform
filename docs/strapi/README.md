# Strapi documentation

This folder centralizes technical notes, migrations, and operating conventions for the official `strapi` workspace.

- `workspaces.md` - workspace overview, responsibilities, and day-to-day operations.
- `staging-data.md` - how to populate staging safely without re-enabling automatic seeds.
- `database-scaling.md` - database strategy (SQLite <-> Postgres), multi-instance deployment, and container notes.
- `realtime-apis.md` - backend API contract for feed, highlights, stream, realtime corridors, and persistent connections.

Add new guides here whenever you introduce an API, seed flow, or plugin configuration change.
