# Openg7Org

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 19.2.10.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

To exercise the Express SSR entry point locally, build the application and run the dedicated script:

```bash
yarn build:preprod
yarn serve:ssr:openg7-org
```

This starts the Node server from `dist/openg7-org/server/server.mjs`, loading the runtime manifest generated by `scripts/generate-runtime-config.mjs` before each build. 【F:openg7-org/package.json†L6-L32】【F:openg7-org/src/server.ts†L1-L126】【F:openg7-org/scripts/generate-runtime-config.mjs†L1-L200】

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

When targeting pre-production or containerised deployments, generate the runtime manifest and build in one step:

```bash
yarn build:preprod
```

This command calls `scripts/generate-runtime-config.mjs` to write `public/runtime-config.js` (consumed before Angular bootstraps) and then runs the standard production build. The generated assets include the Express server (`dist/openg7-org/server/server.mjs`) used in SSR mode. 【F:openg7-org/scripts/generate-runtime-config.mjs†L1-L200】【F:openg7-org/src/server.ts†L1-L126】

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
